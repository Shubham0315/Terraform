Getting started with Terraforn
-
- To create S3 on AWS - Go to AWS Console - Provide user and pass to authenticate - Search for S3 - Provide details like name, access, versioning enabled - Create
- But creating 100s of buckets will require more time manually. Here we can follow programmatic approach like AWS CLI. We can also talk to AWS services through API programatically/call AWS service using program
- Using scripting we can create multiple resources in AWS in fraction of time. 
  - So we're reducing our effort.
  - But here we need programming knowledge of python or other scripting language. In case of VPC we cannot do using the same
- Here cloud providers give us cloud formation template (CFT) which we can write in JSON/YML. CFT allow to write our infra as code. Here we can write our resources in YML/JSON and apply it to create resources.

- For every tool, there are IaC tools inbuilt like AWS has CFT, Azure has ARM which automate infra reducing efforts of Devops engineer.
- Then why terraform?
  - If different projects in our company are on different cloud platforms. To learn all tools is not possible. So terraform provides universal approach.
  - We can define provider to terrraform where we want to autoate infra AWS/AZURE/GCP. Terraform knowledge is enough to create resources on different cloud platforms
  - Terraform uses API as a code where it directly talk to cloud provider APIs. Using HCL language code is converted to required cloud provider APIs, then terraform applies APIs to create infra
  - Thats why terraform is also called as "API as a Code"
